Experiment 5: Implement a noise model and apply spatial filtering techniques for image restoration.
Theory
Noise degrades image quality during acquisition or transmission. Gaussian noise and salt-and-pepper noise are common models. Spatial filters such as mean and median filters are used for restoration.
Algorithm
1.	Add Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise to the image.
2.	Apply mean and median filtering.
3.	Compare noisy and restored images.
