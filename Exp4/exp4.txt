Experiment 4: Apply frequency domain filtering to an image. Implement both low pass and high pass filters, and demonstrate their effects.
Theory
Frequency domain filtering modifies image characteristics by manipulating its Fourier transform. Low pass filters reduce noise and blur the image, whereas high pass filters enhance edges.
Algorithm
1.	Convert image to frequency domain using FFT.
2.	Apply low pass and high pass masks.
3.	Convert back to spatial domain using inverse FFT.
